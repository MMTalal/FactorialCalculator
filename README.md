# Factorial Calculator

This Python program calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Validates if the entered number is non-negative.
- Calculates the factorial of the entered number.
- Displays the intermediate results during the calculation.
- Prints the final result of the factorial.
